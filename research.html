<h1 id="research">Research</h1>
<p>Some of my current research projects are described below, and a complete list of my publications can be found on my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9_wnKjkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Google Scholar</a> page.</p>
<p>My current research interests are primarily in the philosophy of information (especially info ethics) and human-computer interaction (especially info organisation and retrieval). Through my research I seek to understand fundamental interactions with and understandings of information so that we can better support people in their everyday lives in the information society, which necessarily requires integrating technical, social, and philosophical research methods.</p>
<h2 id="ai-future-lab-l3s">AI Future Lab @ L3S</h2>
<p><em>Topics: responsible AI, data ethics, health informatics</em></p>
<p>Modern medicine is being revolutionised by artificial intelligence, but employing AI and health data responsibly requires careful collaboration between experts from many areas. I am an affiliate member of the international <a href="https://leibniz-ai-lab.de/">AI Future Lab</a> hosted by the <a href="https://www.l3s.de/en">Leibniz Research Center</a>, where leading researchers from Germany, the US, Singapore, India, Australia and New Zealand are creating responsible AI for personalised medicine thanks to a multi-year grant from the German Ministry for Education and Research (<a href="https://www.bmbf.de/de/internationale-zukunftslabore-8021.html">BMBF</a>).</p>

<h2 id="hidden-heritage">Hidden Heritage</h2>
<p><em>Topics: cultural heritage, personal information management, GLAMR, software design</em></p>
<p>The personal collections of notable people can represent considerable cultural heritage value for current and future generations, but are easily lost through emotional or practical obstacles to faced by the individuals, their families when they inherit the collections, or the institutions that would preserve and provide access to the collections. Together with researchers at <a href="https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/">Victoria University of Wellington</a> (NZ) I am working on the <a href="https://hiddenheritage.vuw.ac.nz">Hidden Heritage</a> project to examine and address such issues using qualitative and quantitative research techniques from library science and human-computer interaction (e.g. novel <a href="https://github.com/jddinneen/collection-annotation-assistant">collection annotation software</a>). This project, for which I am currently seeking research assistants, is funded by a multi-year university grant.</p>
<h2 id="embedding-lis-values-in-ai-powered-info-services">Embedding LIS values in AI-powered info services</h2>
<p><em>Topics: responsible AI, philosophy of information, history and identity of LIS</em></p>
<p>AI is changing information services (e.g. chat bots performing <a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/about-deakin/media-releases/articles/ibm-watson-helps-deakin-drive-the-digital-frontier">reference services</a>), but so far info professionals are at the mercy of such innovations rather than at the helm (e.g. informing the design of such systems). Extending my work in the <a href="http://sites.utexas.edu/goodsystemscscw/files/2019/10/GoodSystemsCSCW2019WorkshopPapers.pdf">ethics</a> and <a href="https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/89817/63.3.dinneen.pdf?sequence=2&amp;isAllowed=y">philosophy</a> of information, I am developing a long-term agenda to embed the values of information professionals into the design of AI-powered information systems and services. Draft project stages include (1) explicating the values and vision of LIS and the GLAMR sector, building community consensus around AI services; (2) reconciling competing values, drafting and disseminating guidelines; (3) translating and implementing values and identifying relevant techniques for AI alignment. I am currently seeking collaborators and feedback for this project, for which seed funding has been acquired.</p>
<h2 id="designing-data-driven-file-management-tools">Designing data-driven file management tools</h2>
<p><em>Topics: human-computer interaction, personal information management, info organisation and retrieval</em></p>
<p>Building on the results of work I began in my PhD – examining <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3290605.3300557">how people manage their digital information</a> and how to therefore <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3176349.3176385">effectively modify and display large knowledge structures</a> – I am developing and testing <a href="https://github.com/jddinneen/GIMZoomer">novel software</a> that enables the flexible display and browsing of co-managed information structures. I am currently seeking research assistants for this project.</p>
