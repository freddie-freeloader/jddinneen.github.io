<h1 id="research">Research</h1>
<p>Some of my current research projects are described below, and a complete list of my publications can be found on my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9_wnKjkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Google Scholar</a> page.</p>
<p>My current research interests are primarily in the philosophy of information (especially info ethics) and human-computer interaction (especially info organisation and retrieval). Through my research I seek to understand fundamental interactions with and understandings of information so that we can better support people in their everyday lives in the information society, which necessarily requires integrating technical, social, and philosophical research methods.</p>
<h2 id="ai-future-lab-l3s">AI Future Lab @ L3S</h2>
<p><em>Topics: responsible AI, data ethics, health informatics</em></p>
<p>I am an affiliate member of the international <a href="https://leibniz-ai-lab.de/">AI Future Lab</a> hosted by the <a href="https://www.l3s.de/en">Leibniz Research Center</a>, where we are creating responsible AI for personalised medicine. This project involves research institutions from Germany, the US, Singapore, India, Australia and New Zealand, and is funded by a multi-year grant from the German Ministry for Education and Research (<a href="https://www.bmbf.de/de/internationale-zukunftslabore-8021.html">BMBF</a>).</p>

<h2 id="hidden-heritage">Hidden Heritage</h2>
<p><em>Topics: cultural heritage, personal information management, GLAMR, software design</em></p>
<p>Together with researchers at <a href="https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/">Victoria University of Wellington</a> (NZ) I am working on the <a href="https://hiddenheritage.vuw.ac.nz">Hidden Heritage</a> project, which examines the cultural heritage potential within personal collections of significant individuals and the issues people face when organising such collections and donating them (e.g. to galleries, libraries, archives, and museums). The project employs qualitative and quantitative research techniques from library science and human-computer interaction (e.g. novel <a href="https://github.com/jddinneen/collection-annotation-assistant">collection annotation software</a>), and is funded by a multi-year university grant. I am currently seeking research assistants for this project.</p>
<h2 id="embedding-lis-values-in-ai-powered-info-services">Embedding LIS values in AI-powered info services</h2>
<p><em>Topics: responsible AI, philosophy of information, history and identity of LIS</em></p>
<p>Extending my work in the <a href="http://sites.utexas.edu/goodsystemscscw/files/2019/10/GoodSystemsCSCW2019WorkshopPapers.pdf">ethics</a> and <a href="https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/89817/63.3.dinneen.pdf?sequence=2&amp;isAllowed=y">philosophy</a> of information, I am developing a long-term agenda to embed the values of information professionals into the design of information systems and services powered by artificial intelligence. Draft project stages include (1) identifying and specifying relevant values among GLAMR sector mission statements, building consensus in the LIS community (2) refining and reconciling competing values, drafting and disseminating guidelines (3) translating and implementing values and identifying relevant techniques for AI alignment. I am currently seeking collaborators and feedback for this project, for which university seed funding has been acquired.</p>
<h2 id="designing-data-driven-file-management-tools">Designing data-driven file management tools</h2>
<p><em>Topics: human-computer interaction, personal information management, info organisation and retrieval</em></p>
<p>Building on the results of work I began in my PhD – examining <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3290605.3300557">how people manage their digital information</a> and how to therefore <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3176349.3176385">effectively modify and display large knowledge structures</a> – I am developing and testing <a href="https://github.com/jddinneen/GIMZoomer">novel software</a> that enables the flexible display and browsing of co-managed information structures. I am currently seeking research assistants for this project.</p>
